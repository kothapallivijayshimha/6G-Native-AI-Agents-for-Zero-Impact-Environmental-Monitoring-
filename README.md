# 6G: The Connectivity Fabric for the Gravity-Defying Era

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of **6G Wireless Technology** with **Anti-Gravity and Space Environments**, focusing on next-generation communication systems for zero-gravity, high-gravity, and orbital environments.

## 🎯 Key Research Areas

1. **Zero-Gravity Communication** - Terahertz waves and LEO satellite integration for lunar/orbital habitats
2. **Gravity Sensing** - ISAC for monitoring gravitational stresses on structures
3. **High-G Monitoring** - IoB sensors for astronaut vitals in 6G-force centrifuges
4. **Environmental Safety** - Green 6G beamforming for biological safety
